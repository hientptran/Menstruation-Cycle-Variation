# Menstrual cycle variation by demographic characteristics
**Hien Tran - Wintersemester 2023/2024 - Analyse medizinischer Daten**

### Overview
Characteristics such as cycle length, menses length, menstrual blood flow, etc. are important indicators of a menstruating person's health. Understanding the relationship between these menstrual characteristics and demographic factors, such as age, race, and Body Mass Index (BMI), is essential for providing comprehensive reproductive health assessments and inclusive healthcare solutions. In this paper, such characteristics in a menstrual cycle data set provided by The Institute for Natural Family Planning at Marquette University will be examined and analyzed for correlation with the person's demographic characteristics. 

The dataset presented in this study originated from a study comparing two Internet supported methods of natural family planning from Marquette University (Fehring 2012b). In addition to data collected on the usage of  fertility monitors, Fehring also acquired menstrual cycle data of 159 participants (Fehring 2012a). I used Jupyter Notebook with the NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib libraries for the data analysis, and LaTeX to write the documentation.
